An incredible amount of data is available in text files. Text files can con-tain weather data, traffic data, socioeconomic data, literary works, and more. Reading from a file is particularly useful in data analysis applica-tions, but it’s also applicable to any situation in which you want to ana-lyze or modify information stored in a file. For example, you can write a program that reads in the contents of a text file and rewrites the file with formatting that allows a browser to display it.When you want to work with the information in a text file, the first step is to read the file into memory. You can read the entire contents of a file, or you can work through the file one line at a time.
